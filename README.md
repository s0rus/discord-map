# MAPA GORYLI

This app's purpose is to give a certain discord community a way to know eachother better
and let them know where they are from by logging all saved users as markers on a map.
When the marker is clicked you get all the info about a concrete user you need.
The list also serves as a navigation, when the user from it is clicked, the map
centers on them and displays all the info.

I used the following things to create this app:

- REACT
- REACT ROUTER
- STYLED COMPONENTS
- REACT-HOOK-FORM
- MAPBOX API + REACT-MAP-GL
- DISCORD API
- EXPRESS.JS
- AXIOS
